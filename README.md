## A TUI to manage tmux.

This is a TUI to manage tmux sessions.

**:construction: It's currently under heavy construction and might break unexpectetly. :construction:**

## Usage

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:stoeffel/tmux-tui.git
$ cabal install
```

Last compiled using GCH version 9.2.7 and cabal version 3.6.2.0

I recommend setting up a keybinding to get to the TUI from anywhere.

`bind -n C-h new-window -n tmux-tui -c "#{pane_current_path}" "tmux-tui"`

And, if you want to switch to any open window if there is already a tmux-tui instance running use this.
`bind -n C-h run-shell "tmux switch-client -t :tmux-tui || tmux new-window -k -n tmux-tui -c '#{pane_current_path}' 'tmux-tui'"`

### Starting

`tmux-tui` will startup `tmux` if you are running the command from outside `tmux`.
It creates a session that will be destroyed after you start or create a session.


### The TUI

There are 4 panels.

**Stored**: Contains stored session.
  Stores:
  * layout
  * windows and panes
  * current path and command (might not work yet in non OSX OS) of panes.
**Sessions**: Active sessions
**Windows**: Windows in session or stored session.
**Panes**: Panes dependant on focus per window or session.

There is a context sensitive help at the bottom of the screen.
